## Introduction

Real-time Alert Platform for Informed Decisions (RAPID) is a sponsored project by the J Healthcare Initiative, a non-profit organization dedicated to empowering drug usersâ€™ healthcare choices.

RAPID implements clear criteria to identify and alert about illicit drug batches, significantly improving public health outcomes. This data-driven approach enhances healthcare system preparedness, enables more effective resource allocation, and facilitates evidence-based policy development. It also lays the foundation for robust research by offering insights into illicit drug trends.
